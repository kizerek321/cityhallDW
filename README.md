# Gdańsk City Hall – Request & Complaint Analytics System

A data-driven analytical system designed to support Gdańsk City Hall in monitoring and improving their core public service processes — **document request handling** and **public complaint management**.

## Project Purpose

The City Hall aims to ensure **faster and more efficient service for citizens**, with a strategic goal to reduce the **average request wait time by 3% annually**. Our project supports this goal by providing insights into:

- Request and complaint trends
- Staff performance
- Peak activity periods
- Request processing efficiency

## Business Processes Analyzed

### 1. Requesting a Document

Citizens can request documents such as ID cards or vehicle registrations either:

- Online (via the City Hall website)
- In-person (at the facility)

These requests are processed through several stages: **submission → scheduling → processing → completion**.

#### Key Analytical Questions

- What is the average wait time this month vs. last month?
- Which document types have the longest/shortest wait times?
- Are online requests processed faster than in-person ones?
- What percentage of requests meet the target completion time?
- How does performance vary by official and by document type?

### 2. Managing Public Complaints

Citizens submit complaints regarding public services (e.g. noise, road issues). Complaints are:

- Logged ➡️ Categorized ➡️ Assigned ➡️ Reviewed ➡️ Resolved

#### Key Analytical Questions

- What is the average complaint resolution time this month?
- Which categories are most frequent or take the longest to resolve?
- Do online complaints get resolved faster?
- On which days are most complaints submitted?
- What percentage of complaints are resolved within 30 days?

## Relationships Between Data

- **CITIZEN ↔ REQUEST** (One-to-Many): One citizen may have multiple document requests.
- **OFFICIAL ↔ REQUEST** (One-to-Many): Each request is processed by one official.
- **REQUEST ↔ Reason Files** (One-to-One): Each request has one record in the reason CSV files.

## Example Analytical Scenarios

### Demand Tracking
- Total document requests this vs. last month
- Online vs. in-person requests per month
- Peaks in submission days or times

- Efficiency during peak vs. off-peak periods

---

## Additional Insights (Future Enhancements)

- Compare foreign vs. native citizen service times (requires ethnicity data)
- Collect post-service feedback from citizens (requires feedback system)

---

## KPIs & Business Goals

- Reduce average wait time by **0.25% monthly**
- Reduce request processing time by **0.25% monthly**
- Maintain/increase number of processed requests
- Achieve high percentage of requests resolved within estimated time
